# Payback
This is a Street Fighter inspired fighter. A 1v1 character fighting game using 3D models.
We have 3 developers and 4 artists, each with their own specialties.
To accomplish this we are using programming techniques such as finite state machines, objectpools and writing our own dataclasses: such as one to make special fighting game inputs much easier to program.
